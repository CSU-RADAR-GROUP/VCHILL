- Investigate whether the ViewFileBrowser tree expanding code should modify the
  main control message (what it does now) or if it should create a new message
  and pass it to the neccessary methods.
- Add in more synchronization to ViewImageDisplay to prevent images from being
  removed while images are being retrieved.
- Determine if VCHILL has a sweep or cache issue because sometimes the server
  says it sent data to VCHILL but VCHILL doesn't seem to think it has the data.
  Update: The changes made to how field data is read in may have corrected this
  issue but it's still important to look into if the scale manager is causing
  problems by removing fields and setting available fields.
